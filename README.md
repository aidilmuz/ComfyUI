# Improvements On The Workflow
- I experimented with **LoRAs** to captivate a specific style in my images. Examples of LoRAs that I used are [Pokemon Style](https://civitai.com/models/5115/pokemon-lora-ken-sugimori-style-for-fakemon-and-characters)   and also [Chinese Dragon Style](https://civitai.com/models/225915/chinese-dragon-lora)
- I used **Advanced KSampler** to generate high-quality and stylized outputs
